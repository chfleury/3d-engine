# This is a bare bones solution for rendering 3d objects on the terminal screen!
I implemented this code by following the c++ tutorial of how to code your own 3d graphics engine from javidx9.
It was my first contact with rust so it needs a lot of refactor.
It only works on unix terminals, and you need minimum zoom possible to be able to see a decent amount of pixels (lines and columns on the terminal).
All the pixels are just the char 'o'.
